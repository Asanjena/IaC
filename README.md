## Ansible 

Ansible is a configuration manager 

It is a extremely powerful, simple, and agentless automation tool

**Powerful** - Ansible can manage and facilitate 2 to thousands of servers. You can have different tasks being conducted on different servers all at the same time

**Simple** - Ansible only requires a few lines of code 

**Agentless** - It is agentless, meaning that only the controller needs to have ansible installed. This is beneficial ass if you have lots of servers, e.g., 200, all of these do not need to have ansible installed, helpting to save lots of time.
